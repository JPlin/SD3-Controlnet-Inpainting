# Updates

âœ¨ðŸŽ‰ This model has been merged into [Diffusers](https://moon-ci-docs.huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/pr_9099/en/api/pipelines/controlnet_sd3) and can now be used conveniently. ðŸ’¡ ðŸŽ‰âœ¨

# Examples

## SD3 Controlnet Inpainting

Finetuned controlnet inpainting model based on sd3-medium, the inpainting model offers several advantages:

* Leveraging the SD3 16-channel VAE and high-resolution generation capability at 1024, the model effectively preserves the integrity of non-inpainting regions, including text.

* It is capable of generating text through inpainting.

* It demonstrates superior aesthetic performance in portrait generation.

# Using with Diffusers

Install from source and Run

``` Shell
pip uninstall diffusers
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

``` python
import torch
from diffusers.utils import load_image, check_min_version
from diffusers.pipelines import StableDiffusion3ControlNetInpaintingPipeline
from diffusers.models.controlnet_sd3 import SD3ControlNetModel

controlnet = SD3ControlNetModel.from_pretrained(
    "alimama-creative/SD3-Controlnet-Inpainting", use_safetensors=True, extra_conditioning_channels=1

    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
)
pipe.text_encoder.to(torch.float16)
pipe.controlnet.to(torch.float16)
pipe.to("cuda")

## Training Detail

The model was trained on 12M laion2B and internal source images for 20k steps at resolution 1024x1024. 

* Mixed precision : FP16
* Learning rate : 1e-4
* Batch size : 192
* Timestep sampling mode : 'logit_normal'
* Loss : Flow Matching

## Limitation

Due to the fact that only 1024*1024 pixel resolution was used during the training phase, the inference performs best at this size, with other sizes yielding suboptimal results. We will initiate multi-resolution training in the future, and at that time, we will open-source the new weights.
